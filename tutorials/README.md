# PySDM tutorials

PySDM tutorial notebooks are designed to introduce users to fundamental cloud microphysical processes. Each tutorial includes introductory information about the relevant chemistry and physics, a widget-based code example where the user can explore how simulation results depend on various parameter values, and a set of questions to assess comprehension. These notebooks were originally designed for an introductory cloud physics course for advanced undergraduate and first-year graduate students.

### Collisions
A 0-D box model tutorial of the collision-coalescence process. Based on the [Shima et al. 2009]() example.

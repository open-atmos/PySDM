PySDM offers a set of building blocks for development of atmospheric cloud
simulation systems revolving around the particle-based microphysics modelling concept
and the Super-Droplet Method algorithm ([Shima et al. 2009](https://doi.org/10.1002/qj.441))
for numerically tackling the probabilistic representation of particle coagulation.

For an overview of PySDM, see [Bartman, Arabas et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.17238).
PySDM is released under the [GNU GPL v3 license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).
PySDM development has been spearheaded at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science,
[Jagiellonian University in Krak√≥w](https://en.uj.edu.pl/en) (the copyright holder).

For details on PySDM dependencies and installation procedures, see project
[README.md file](https://github.com/open-atmos/PySDM/blob/master/README.md)
which also includes basic usage examples in **Python**, **Julia** and **Matlab**.

A set of more elaborate examples engineered in Python and accompanied by Jupyter
notebooks are maintained in the
[PySDM-examples package](https://github.com/open-atmos/PySDM-examples).

PySDM test-suite built using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) is located in the
[tests package](https://github.com/open-atmos/PySDM/tree/master/tests).

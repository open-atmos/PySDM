"""
Physical constants and formulae (mostly one-liners)
  that can be automatically either njit-ted or translated to C (in contrast to
  more complex code that resides in backends). Note that any code here should
  only use constants defined in `PySDM.physics.constants_defaults` and accessible
  through the first `const` argument of each formula, for the following reasons:
  - it makes it possible for a user to override value of any constant by
    passing a `constants` dictionary to the `__init__` of `Formulae`;
  - it enforces floating-point cast on all constant values making the code behave
    in the same way on both CPU and GPU backends (yes, please use `const.ONE/const.TWO`
    instead of `1/2`);
  - it enables dimensional analysis logic if the code in question is embedded
    in `with DimensionalAnalysis:` block - allows checking physical unit consistency
    within unit tests (disable by default, no runtime overhead);
  - last but not least, it requires all the constants to be named
    (thus resulting in more readable, and more reusable code).

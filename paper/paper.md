# Summary

`PySDM` and the accompanying `PySDM-examples` packages are open-source modeling tools
  for computational studies of atmospheric clouds, aerosols, and precipitation.
The project hinges on the particle-based microphysics modeling approach and Pythonic code design.
The eponymous `SDM` refers to the Super Droplet Method -- a 
  Monte-Carlo algorithm introduced in @Shima_et_al_2009 to represent the coagulation
  of particles in modeling frameworks such as Large-Eddy Simulations (LES) of atmospheric
  flows. 
Recent efforts have culminated
  in the "v2" release line, which includes representation of a variety of new processes 
  for both liquid and ice-phase particles,
  performance enhancements such as adaptive time-stepping, as well as a broadened suite of 
  examples which demonstrate, test, and motivate the use of the SDM for cloud modeling research.


# Background and Statement of Need

The key motivation behind development of `PySDM` has been to offer the community an approachable,
  readily reusable software for users and developers who wish to contribute to the
  scientific progress of particle-based methods for simulating atmospheric clouds.
To this end, we strive to maintain modularity of the `PySDM` building blocks, separation of
  functionality and examples, and extensive unit test coverage in the project.
A user of the package can select top-level options such as the simulation
  environment, particle processes, and output attributes without a detailed grasp
  of the CPU and GPU backend code.

`PySDM` "v1" featured representation of the following 
  processes: condensational growth/evaporation, collisional growth,
  aqueous sulfur chemistry, and coupling of particle transport
  and vapor/heat budget with grid-discretized fluid flow.
This paper outlines subsequent developments in the "v2" releases of `PySDM`
  including representation of three new processes (collisional breakup, immersion freezing, 
  and surface-partitioning of organic aerosol components), 
  initialization framework for aerosol size and composition,
  enhanced support for adaptive time-stepping, and additional illustrative examples.

In the companion `PySDM-examples` package, we continue to expand and maintain 
  a set of examples demonstrating project features through automated reproduction of results from literature.
The examples package serves multiple roles in the project.
First, it guides users and developers through the package features.
Second, `PySDM-examples` has been used as educational material, offering
  interactive Jupyter notebooks suitable for hands-on demonstrations of basic cloud-physics
  simulations.
Third, inclusion of simulation scripts/notebooks pertaining to
  new research papers can streamline assessment of the
  results by reviewers.
Running simulations described in a paper can be done independently on a cloud-computing platform 
  such as Google Colab or mybinder.org.
Finally, we require new examples introduced into `PySDM-examples` to be accompanied by 
  a set of "smoke tests" in `PySDM`,
  which assert results against reference data to ensure that published results remain 
  reproducible with future developments of `PySDM`.


# Summary of new features and examples in v2

For an example of running basic zero-dimensional
  simulations with `PySDM`, we refer to the project `README.md` file and @Bartman_et_al_2022_JOSS.
The key building blocks of the `PySDM` API and class hierarchy are: "attributes", "backends", "dynamics",
  "environments", "products" and physics "formulae".
The following code snippets demonstrate new elements of `PySDM` API, which
  can be added or substituted into the "v1" API description to run 
  simulations using the new features.
Execution of code snippets from both the present "v2" and the previous "v1" papers
  is included in the `PySDM` continuous integration workflow.

## Collisional Breakup

The collisional breakup process represents the splitting of two colliding superdroplets
  into multiple fragments.
It can be specified as an individual `Breakup` "dynamic" or used within a unified
  `Collision` "dynamic", in which the probability of breakup versus coalescence is sampled.
The additional `PySDM` components used in the example below can be imported via:
```python
from PySDM.dynamics.collisions import Collision
from PySDM.dynamics.collisions.collision_kernels import Golovin
from PySDM.dynamics.collisions.coalescence_efficiencies import ConstEc
from PySDM.dynamics.collisions.breakup_efficiencies import ConstEb
from PySDM.dynamics.collisions.breakup_fragmentations import ExponFrag
```
The rate of superdroplet collisions are specified by a collision kernel, and the
  breakup process requires three additional specifications: `coalescence_efficiencies`
  (probability of coalescence occurring), `breakup_efficiencies` (probability of breakup occurring
  if not coalescence), and `breakup_fragmentations` (the number
  of fragments formed in the case of a breakup event). 

```python
from PySDM import Builder
from PySDM.backends import CPU
from PySDM.environments import Box
from PySDM.physics import si
from PySDM.formulae import Formulae

formulae = Formulae(fragmentation_function="ExponFrag")
builder = Builder(backend=CPU(formulae), n_sd=100)
builder.set_environment(Box(dv=1 * si.m**3, dt=1 * si.s))
frag_scale = formulae.trivia.volume(radius=100 * si.micrometres)
builder.add_dynamic(Collision(
  collision_kernel=Golovin(b=1.5e3 / si.s),
  coalescence_efficiency=ConstEc(Ec=0.9),
  breakup_efficiency=ConstEb(Eb=1.0),
  fragmentation_function=ExponFrag(scale=frag_scale),
  adaptive=True,
))
```

In `PySDM-examples`, we introduced a set of notebooks reproducing figures from two publications.
In @Bieli_et_al_2022, `PySDM` results from collisional coalescence and breakup 
  were used as a calibration tool for learning microphysical rate parameters.
In @DeJong_et_al_2022, the physics of and algorithm for superdroplet breakup are described,
  and the impact of breakup on cloud properties is demonstrated with box and single-column
  simulations (the latter based on @Shipway_and_Hill_2012).

## Immersion Freezing

This release of `PySDM` introduces representation of immersion freezing, 
  i.e. liquid-solid phase change contingent on the presence of insoluble ice nuclei immersed in supercooled water droplets.
There are two alternative models implemented: the singular approach presented in 
  @Shima_et_al_2020, and the time-dependent approach of @Alpert_and_Knopf_2016.
For the time-dependent model, the water Activity Based Immersion Freezing Model (ABIFM)
  of @Knopf_and_Alpert_2013 is used.
The `Freezing` "dynamic" is introduced by specifying whether a singular model is used, 
  and additional particle attributes (either freezing temperature or immersed surface area)
  must be initialized accordingly.
```python
from PySDM.dynamics import Freezing
builder.add_dynamic(Freezing(singular=False))
```

For validation of the the newly introduced immersion freezing models, a set of
  notebooks reproducing box-model simulations from @Alpert_and_Knopf_2016 was introduced
  to the `PySDM-examples` package.
A comparison of the time-dependent and singular models using 
  a two-dimensional kinematic prescribed-flow framework was the focus of @Arabas_et_al_2022.

## Initialization of multi-component internally or externally mixed aerosol

The new aerosol initialization framework introduced in `PySDM` "v2" allows flexible specification 
  of multi-modal, multi-component aerosol.
The `DryAerosolMixture` class takes a tuple of compounds and dictionaries specifying their molar masses,
  densities, solubilities, and ionic dissociation numbers.
The user specifies the aerosol `modes` which are comprised of a `kappa` hygroscopicity value, 
  calculated from the molecular components and their associated `mass_fractions`,
  and a dry aerosol size `spectrum`.
For example, a single-mode aerosol class (`SimpleAerosol`) can be defined as follows.
```python
from PySDM.initialisation import spectra
from PySDM.initialisation.aerosol_composition import DryAerosolMixture
class SimpleAerosol(DryAerosolMixture):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            compounds=("(NH4)2SO4", "NaCl"),
            molar_masses={"(NH4)2SO4": 132.14 * si.g / si.mole,
              "NaCl": 58.44 * si.g / si.mole},
            densities={"(NH4)2SO4": 1.77 * si.g / si.cm**3,
              "NaCl": 2.16 * si.g / si.cm**3},
            is_soluble={"(NH4)2SO4": True, "NaCl": True},
            ionic_dissociation_phi={"(NH4)2SO4": 3, "NaCl": 2},
        )
        self.modes = ({
            "kappa": self.kappa(
              mass_fractions={"(NH4)2SO4": 0.7, "NaCl": 0.3}),
            "spectrum": spectra.Lognormal(
                norm_factor=100 / si.cm**3,
                m_mode=50 * si.nm, s_geom=2
            ),
        },)
```
An aerosol object (instance of `DryAerosolMixture` subclass) is used during initialization to calculate the total number of 
  superdroplets given a prescribed number per mode, sample the size spectrum from the aerosol 
  `spectrum` property, and initialize the `kappa times dry volume` attribute using the 
  hygroscopicity property `kappa`.
The choice of `kappa times dry volume` as an extensive attribute ensures that, upon coalescence,
  the hygroscopicity of a resultant super-particle is the volume-weighted average of the hygroscopicity 
  of the coalescing super-particles.
The new aerosol initialization framework is used in several examples in `PySDM-examples` including a new 
  example that reproduces results from @Abdul_Razzak_and_Ghan_2000, comparing `PySDM` 
  simulations against data retrieved from the
  publication as shown in \autoref{fig:ARG}).

The figure shows the results from `PySDM` in color with two definitions of activated fraction based on the critical supersaturation threshold (Scrit) or the critical volume threshold (Vcrit). For comparison, we include the parameterization developed in @Abdul_Razzak_and_Ghan_2000 as formulated in their paper (solid line) and as implemented in a new Julia model (`CloudMicrophysics.jl`, dashed line), as well as the results from simulations reported in @Abdul_Razzak_and_Ghan_2000 (black dots).](joss-ARG-fig_1.pdf){#fig:ARG width="100%"}

## Surface-partitioning of organics to modify surface tension of droplets

`PySDM` "v2" includes a new example demonstrating the available models for droplet surface tension.
The four surface tension options included in `PySDM`, which define the droplet surface tension as 
  a function of dry aerosol composition and wet radius, are: `'Constant'`, 
  `'CompressedFilmOvadnevaite'` (@Ovadnevaite_et_al_2017), `'CompressedFilmRuehl'` (@Ruehl_et_al_2016), 
  and `'SzyszkowskiLangmuir'` following the Szyszkowski-Langmuir equation.
Parameters for the three surface-partitioning models must be specified as shown below.
A full comparison of the four surface tension models can be found in the `Singer_Ward` example.
```python
from PySDM import Formulae
f = Formulae(
    surface_tension='CompressedFilmOvadnevaite',
    constants={
        'sgm_org': 35 * si.mN / si.m,
        'delta_min': 1.75 * si.nm
    }
)
```

## Adaptive time-stepping

In `PySDM` "v2", the `Condensation`, `Collision`, and `Displacement` "dynamics"
  all support adaptive time-stepping logic,
  which involves sub-stepping within the user-specified time step used for coupling
  with the "environment".
Adaptivity is enabled by default and can be disabled by passing `False` as the value of optional `adaptive`
  keyword to the given dynamic.
This adaptive time-stepping applies separately in each grid box of a multidimensional environment,
  and includes a load-balancing logic as described in @Bartman_et_al_2023.
In the case of collisions, the time-step adaptivity is aimed at eliminating errors
  associated with multiple coalescence events within a timestep.
In the case of condensation, the time-step adaptivity is aimed at reducing computational
  load by coupling the time-step length choice with ambient supersaturation leading
  to using longer time-steps in cloud-free regions and shorter time-steps in regions
  where droplet [de]activation or rain evaporation occurs.
In the case of displacement, the time-step adaptivity is aimed at obeying a given tolerance
  in integration of the super-particle trajectories, and the error measure is constructed
  by comparing implicit- and explicit-Euler solutions.

# Relevant recent open-source developments
`PySDM` supports a `PyMPDATA`-based [@Bartman_et_al_2022_MP] reimplementation of the 1D kinematically-driven test framework in a recently-published intercomparison of microphysics methods [@Hill_et_al_2023]. 
The authors are unaware of recent SDM algorithm implementations in open-source packages beyond those mentioned in [@Bartman_et_al_2022_JOSS]
  and the related list of links in the `PySDM` README file. 
Furthermore, none of these implementations include superdroplet-count-conserving collisional breakup,
  organic surface partitioning or adaptive time-stepping for coagulation. 
The aerosol initialization method described
  in `PySDM` v2 is similar to that of `pyrcel` [@Rothenberg_and_Wang_2017].
Leveraging the availability of `PyPartMC` - a new Python interface to the `PartMC` particle-resolved Monte-Carlo aerosol simulation code [@PyPartMC_AMS2023],
  `PySDM` test suite has been extended with automated checks against `PartMC`.
